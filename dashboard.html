            Smith is working with SF house to arrange games. It may be sporadic
            in the beginning as they are looking for a coach, but we should be
            able to have scrimmages and games with the other teams that have
            coaches. We will eventually look to have games weekly, preferably
            Saturdays.

            We are looking to play in 1-2 tournaments before the summer. We will
            gauge readiness and family schedules, but looking at the end of
            April (Spring Championship) and mid-May (Spring Finale). These dates
            are definitely not set, not-mandatory, but we view them as a great
            way to expose our kids to different levels of the sport from
            different cities/regions.
