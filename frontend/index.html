            Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in
            games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to
            just go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the
            "compete to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play and have
            fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive
            drills, does a better job of preparing players to compete in real
            games. Technically, this is called transference. What you do in
            practice carries over into what you do in games.

            Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble
            knockout are very popular. Every player must have his or her own
            basketball. Coach starts the game. Every player must dribble
            constantly, stay in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from all
            other players in the game. Lose control of your basketball or go
            out-of-bounds, and you're eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players
            could start as half the court. After several players are eliminated,
            the boundary is reduced to only inside the 3-point area. Boundary is
            reduced again to the free-throw lane. Finally, when there are just
            two players left, they play the "finals" in the free throw half
            circle.

              Coach Samper has more than a decade of experience coaching youth
              as a developmental skills and team coach. He grew up playing in
              Cleveland at a Div I school during the same time as Lebron James
              and played collegiately and professionally in the ABA and UBA. He
              has run training camps for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Utah Jazz
              and, most recently, was Director of the LA Clippers Youth
              Basketball Program. He has trained with the likes of Kyrie Irving,
              Al Jefferson, Kyle Korver, and many more top NBA talent. Coach
              Samper works and resides in Santa Barbara, CA as a teacher at a
              local private school for elementary through middle school and is a
              1:1 coach to many of the local kids across the city. His forte is
              utilizing innovative tools for practical skills development while
              making every session, practice, and game a fun and rewarding
              experience. Most importantly, his demeanor and positivity working
              with kids is completely in line with our Program Goals and
              Mission. We are fortunate to have someone of his caliber in our
              small locale.
