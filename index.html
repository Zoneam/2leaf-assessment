            Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in
            games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to
            just go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the
            "compete to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play and have
            fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive
            drills, does a better job of preparing players to compete in real
            games. Technically, this is called transference. What you do in
            practice carries over into what you do in games.
