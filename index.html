            Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in
            games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to
            just go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the
            "compete to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play and have
            fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive
            drills, does a better job of preparing players to compete in real
            games. Technically, this is called transference. What you do in
            practice carries over into what you do in games.

            Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble
            knockout are very popular. Every player must have his or her own
            basketball. Coach starts the game. Every player must dribble
            constantly, stay in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from all
            other players in the game. Lose control of your basketball or go
            out-of-bounds, and you're eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players
            could start as half the court. After several players are eliminated,
            the boundary is reduced to only inside the 3-point area. Boundary is
            reduced again to the free-throw lane. Finally, when there are just
            two players left, they play the "finals" in the free throw half
            circle.
